        <h5>To Whom It May Concern:</h5>
            <p>My name is Chris Dortch. I am Co-founder, Stockholder, Director, and President of Global Archive Holdings,
            Inc., which is the parent company to Global Archive, Inc. and owner of various innovative media technologies
            and brands.</p>
 Here are just three of the company’s websites:
 <p>1) MotionLoops.com: a marketplace for DJ’s, where looping video animations can be downloaded, and
            where users can purchase hard drives filled with digital content for their live performances.
            </p>
 <p>2) MotionLogos.com: an innovative tool that converts standard logos uploaded by a user, into 3D logo
            animations.
            </p>
 <p>            3) GlobalArchive.com: a marketplace for film-makers, marketing companies, ad agencies, and social
            media enthusiasts where users can purchase award-winning digital media.</p>
<p>            The Pasadena California based media company recently completed a reorganization/merger with its technology
            counterpart in Austin Texas, and while I am currently involved in the day-to-day operations of the company,
            I am an entrepreneur who is always looking for new projects.</p>
 I would love to discuss any ideas you may have for my company or me.
 <p>            I am available to talk most days between 9 am and 10 pm CDT with 24-hour notice and can be reached almost
            anytime via text (801-362-7229) or Skype (chrisdortch). Please contact me at your earliest convenience regarding
            this or any other ideas you may have. Thanks for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you
            soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

launched 25,000 Youtube videos, created and maintained a massive database
of information. Sold shares for certain contractual rights related to China.
</p>
<p> • In an interview conducted by the Daily Herald, Dortch spoke of digital media
and its role in the Chinese government: “For me there is a deeper mission,”
Dortch said. “We will be contributing to positive media to build a better
society” (heraldextra.com/news/local/central/orem/orem-s-cmg-partners-withchinese-
multimedia-group/article_cdcff92d-9876-5042-9c58-143f299b2ae7.
html).</p>
<p>• Adobe called the digital imagery created by Dortch and former partner John
        Farr, “amazing, stunning work” that caused “Goosebumps in the audience!”
        (spark.adobe.com/page/PhCchABGO2URV/). During an international
        television broadcast conducted by SMG, He Jian said, “video production
        and distribution market in China was worth nearly 10 billion Yuan” and
        Dortch’s content was described as “amazing.” Dortch said, we “have shots
        all over the world, from some of the highest peaks of Everest, to some of the
        lowest places on Earth” (youtube.com/watch?v=8g4f4shw5Dk).</p>
<p>• Dortch’s company was described in a special article featured in Markee
        Magazine: “It’s easy to see why the company’s artsy collection is
        noteworthy, as Dortch points out that the company’s cinematographers have
        acquired content ‘in hundreds’ of national parks, in addition to a more recent
        and more daunting task: spending several weeks with the U.S.
        military shooting high-speed footage of C4 explosions, machine guns,
        operating shots from Chinooks, Black Hawk helicopters and many other
        military vehicles” (markeemagazine.com/wp/stock-footage-houses/).</p>
